Pre-requisites
--------------

You will need the 'cmake' build system installed in order to build clog
from source.


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install clog:

  $ tar xzf clog-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                     [1]
  $ cd clog-X.Y.Z                                 [2]
  $ cmake .                                       [3]
  $ make                                          [4]
  $ make test                                     [5]
  $ sudo make install                             [6]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r clog-X.Y.Z                      [7]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory clog-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes cmake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds clog.  This may take a minute.

  5. Optional step that runs the unit tests.  This will take several minutes,
     during which there will be minimal feedback.  Note that thousands of tests
     are run, and some of those tests need to introduce a delay between commands
     which explains the lengthy time.  On completion, will report the number of
     passing and failing tests.  There should be zero failing tests.

  6. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  7. Removes the temporary directory.


Uninstallation
--------------

To uninstall clog, you need the Makefiles, so if you deleted them in step 7
above, they must first be regenerated by following steps [1], [2] and [3].  Then
simply run:

    $ sudo make uninstall


Taskwarrior Build Notes
-----------------------

Clog 1.0.0 has dependencies that are detected by cmake in almost all cases, but
there are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a
little help.

If clog will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating System
notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting section,
which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.
