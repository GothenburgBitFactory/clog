So far, the rules have all involved text string matches.  Clog also supports
regular expressions, with a slightly different syntax:

$ rm ~/.clogrc
$ echo 'default rule /[Ww]ho/ --> red match' >> ~/.clogrc
$ echo 'default rule /n...t/ --> blue match' >> ~/.clogrc

This rules color 'Who' or 'who' red, and the word 'night' (or anything matching
'n...t') blue.
