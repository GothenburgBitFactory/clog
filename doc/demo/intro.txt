Introducing clog.

Clog is a colorized log viewer.  It can spot text on a line in a log file and
apply color to it, a little like this:

$ tail -f access.log | sed -e 's/ error / <red>error<\/red> /g'

This would spot the text ' error ' in access.log and mark up the matched text.
This is what clog does.
